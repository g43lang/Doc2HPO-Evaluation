Delayed migration of a ductal occluder device into the aorta after transcatheter closure of a patent ductus arteriosus is extremely rare. We present a case of delayed migration of a ductal occluder into the descending aorta 4 months after its deployment in an 11-year-old girl. Successful surgical removal of the device from the descending aorta and triple-ligation of the ductus arteriosus was performed via a left thoracotomy. The patient made an uneventful recovery.
