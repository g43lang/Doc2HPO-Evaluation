another interesting abstract - another 3 case and while we know that Doc2HPO cannot differentiate between cases or patients when identifying phenotypes, in this case all 3 cases sharedthe same phenotypes so in this case Doc2HPO works - in abstracts with multiple patients or cases Doc2HPO can still be used, be helpful, be accurate as long as all of the cases are the same/habe the same resuls/phenotypes
