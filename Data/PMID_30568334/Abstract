[Purpose] This case study describes the reacquisition of knee joint function in a patient with Down syndrome after surgery for patellar dislocation using external focus training. [Participant and Methods] The patient was a female aged 24 years with Down syndrome and a low Intelligence Quotient, who suffered from right patellar dislocation. The range of motion in the right knee while walking was 2 to 23 degrees at 3 weeks after surgery. A compensatory gait while walking was confirmed, with her right leg fixed in extension. Her range of motion while lying was 0 to 155 degrees. A task in which the patient reached and touched a ball was performed with the lower extremities while lying down, according to simple instructions from a therapist. Instructions were given using a simple directive phrase. The intervention started with a single-joint exercise and progressed to a multi-joint exercise. [Results] The range of motion was 0 to 68 degrees at 9 weeks after surgery. Her compensatory gait disappeared and she was able to walk more than 2 km. [Conclusion] Even though the patient's low cognitive function made it difficult for her to complete some tasks, training based on external focus enabled her to acquire adequate knee joint function. External focus training was found to be effective for a patient with a low Intelligence Quotient.
