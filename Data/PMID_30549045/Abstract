We present three adults with Down syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treated with hypoglossal nerve stimulation. The average age of these three males was 37.3 years. All patients had severe OSA on polysomnography. Postimplantation titration sleep studies exhibited residual OSA according to average total apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), but there were significant reductions (86%-100%) in the titrated AHI at the ideal device setting. Morbidity of the surgery was low, and there was excellent device adherence, with an average of 57.3 hours/week. All patients reported subjective improvements in symptoms, and one patient experienced improved blood sugar control. Laryngoscope, 2018.
