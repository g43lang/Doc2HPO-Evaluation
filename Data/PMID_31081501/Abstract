There are few published data available about simultaneous bilateral hip fractures. We present the case of a 56-year-old man with Down syndrome and Alzheimer-like dementia with simultaneous bilateral hip fracture. A bilateral partial hip cemented arthroplasty was performed on this patient. The aim was to avoid the partial burden that could be caused by ostheosynthesis, due to the patient's lack of cooperation arising from his mental deterioration and his problems realizing everyday activities. He was able to walk unaided with complete autonomy until his death fourth years later. In our experience, one stage surgery for bilateral hip prosthesis is safe and provides good results in patients with severe mental impairment.
