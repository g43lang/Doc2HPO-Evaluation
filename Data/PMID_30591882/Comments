interesting question to consider - if it is stated that the condition/phenotype improved, should it be counted as a true positive or not? On the one hand, the condition may still be present, which in that case it should be counted as a true positive, however, on the other hand, if the condition has improved or the control of the condition has improved, is the condition relevant or not? In other words, if the control over the condition improved, possibly to the point where the condition is not active, one could argue against its relevance or presence because it is not active. It is definitely a time worthy question.
