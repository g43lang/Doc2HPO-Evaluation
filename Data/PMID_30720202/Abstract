Epidemiological studies, animal models, and case-control studies indicate maternal immune activation may be an important factor involved in disease expression of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Tourette syndrome, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We report eight children (mean age 6y 6mo [range 4-15y]; six males and two females) referred over a 2-year period with at least one of these neurodevelopmental disorders plus a maternal history of thyroid autoimmunity. Seven of eight children presented with an abrupt onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms (OCD [n=6], tics [n=5], and/or psychosis [n=1]), associated with an autistic or global regression. Four children had a pre-existing diagnosis of ASD. Six presentations were preceded by infection, and symptoms followed a relapsing-remitting course in seven children. All children responded to immunomodulatory treatment as indicated by a reduction in psychiatric symptoms, and seven children were also managed with conventional treatment with additional improvement. We propose that maternal autoimmunity can activate fetal microglia or alter transcription of neurodevelopmental vulnerability and/or immune genes in utero, and is an environmental factor that increases the expression and severity of neurodevelopmental problems, and susceptibility to deteriorations after infectious or stress stimuli. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Maternal thyroid autoimmunity may represent a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders in offspring. Atypical neuropsychiatric features in these children may be due to maternal immune activation in utero.
