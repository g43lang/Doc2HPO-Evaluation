Most cases of transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) in neonates with Down syndrome (DS) resolve spontaneously; however, DS-TAM neonates with hydrops fetalis (HF) show poor clinical outcomes. We report three infants with DS-TAM and HF who were treated with exchange transfusion (ET) followed by low-dose cytarabine (LD-CA). All of them survived without developing liver failure, acute leukemia, or other serious adverse events. Our results suggest that this combination treatment with ET and LD-CA would be safe, tolerable and effective as an novel approach for DS-TAM patients with HF.
