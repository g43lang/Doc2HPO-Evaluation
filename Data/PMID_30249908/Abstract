Acute myeloid leukemia has a rare subtype in French-American-British classification as M7 or acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Chromosome abnormalities in cases with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia can affect their prognosis. Evaluation of these abnormalities and their impact are not fully elucidated. This case presentation is about 16 months female who has a rare abnormality (trisomy 3) alongside acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. The remarkable point is that her malignancy is as primary or non-Down syndrome acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. The author's suggestion through this case presentation is the necessity of drawing a cytogenetic profile, especially in cases with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia for better treatment strategies.
