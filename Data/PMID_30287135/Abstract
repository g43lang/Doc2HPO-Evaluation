BACKGROUND:
Compartment syndrome is often considered in patients with long-bone fractures and soft-tissue injuries, but is not as commonly associated with a period of unconsciousness.

CASE REPORT:
A 65-year-old man was brought to our emergency department (ED) because he had lost consciousness for an unknown amount of time after snorting heroin. He had severe pain in his upper right arm. Physical examination revealed right arm edema, paresthesia, tenderness, and firmness to palpation. During the ED assessment, the patient began to experience pain in his right hip to a degree exceeding examination findings. We considered compartment syndrome affecting his upper arm as well as his gluteal muscles. The patient was taken to the operating room for fasciotomy. The triceps muscle was found to be bulging out of the compartment, demonstrating advanced compartment syndrome. A posterior approach to the hip allowed the gluteal sling and the fascia to be released, eliminating tension on the gluteus medius/minimus and gluteus maximus compartments. With physical therapy, the patient regained full flexion and extension in his arm at the elbow, partial extension of his wrist, and range of motion and strength in his hip. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: If not recognized, compartment syndrome can jeopardize limb and life. It should be considered in patients experiencing inordinate pain, especially if they were found unconscious at the incident scene. Pressure-induced ischemia can impair muscle function within hours. If it is not relieved with fasciotomy, the patient can sustain irreversible functional loss.
