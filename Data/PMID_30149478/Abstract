We report a 3-month-old male with Down syndrome (DS), prolonged jaundice and poor weight gain, that showed biliary lithiasis and undiagnosed congenital hypothyroidism (CH).CH should be considered in DS, especially in presence of gastrointestinal symptoms or malformations. Clinicians should be aware of the increased risk of gallstones in hypothyroid children with DS, even in neonatal age.
