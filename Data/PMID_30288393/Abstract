Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration is rare and noteworthy in children. In this 7-year-old, it was documented to have occurred within a year of ataxia presentation. The instigating cancer was stage III adrenal adenocarcinoma, remitted after surgical resection at age 2. When her severe ataxia progressed, neuroinflammation was characterized by high cerebrospinal fluid Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody type 1 titers, oligoclonal bands, and neurofilament light chain. The immunotherapy strategy was to replace IV methylprednisolone, which lowered Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody type 1 titers without clinical improvement, with induction of adrenocorticotropic hormone/intravenous immunoglobulin/rituximab (ACTH/IVIG/rituximab) combination immunotherapy, ACTH/dexamethasone transition, and intravenous immunoglobulin maintenance. She became self-ambulatory and cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory markers regressed. Down syndrome predisposed her to a second cancer, pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 4 years later. Despite reversible cytosine arabinoside-provoked cerebellar toxicity, the ataxia is stable on monthly intravenous immunoglobulin without relapse, now 5 years after initial diagnosis. This report illustrates the use of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers to detect, target, and monitor neuroinflammation, and successful combinations of immunotherapy to better the quality of life.
