RATIONALE:
Uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema (UGH) syndrome could be identified by conventional ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and B-ultrasonography, but failed in some untypical cases. We introduced a novel application of B-ultrasonography in diagnosis of UGH syndrome in a rare case.

PATIENT CONCERNS:
A 60-year-old woman was referred for distending pain with blurred vision for more than 1 month in the right eye after cataract surgery.

DIAGNOSES:
B-ultrasound scanner and UBM demonstrated the Intraocular Lens (IOL) was centered in the bag. No chafing in all directions was detected between IOL and iris/ciliary body. The proposed diagnoses were iridocyclitis and secondary glaucoma of the right eye.

INTERVENTIONS:
The symptoms were not improved after antiinflammation and intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering treatment for 1 month. B-ultrasonography was applied in horizontal, sitting, and head-down positions. The results demonstrated movements of IOLs when position changed. The IOLs were in contact with the iris pigment epithelium in sitting position and head-down positions but not in horizontal position. The dynamic interactions between IOLs and iris/ciliary body implied a diagnosis of UGH syndrome. The IOLs were then extracted.

OUTCOMES:
Two weeks after the IOLs explantation, the IOP significantly reduced to a normal level in both eyes. Ten-month follow-up showed that the IOP was maintained at a normal level.

LESSONS:
The chronically intermittent chafing between IOL and iris in specific head positions would also lead to UGH syndrome. Dynamic application of B-ultrasonography in various head positions could be useful in the diagnosis of an untypical UGH syndrome.
